    <h1>A little Something About Me </h1>
    <p>My name is Danyal Amin and I'm currently studying Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering in the University of Lahore.</p>
    <p>I have always been interested in video editing and web designing so I thought why not learn it professionally while I actually can.</p>
    <p>I still have a lot to learn and I will keep that up until I believe I can not improve any further which I'm sure is not possible because I believe that no matter what level of skills you have, there is always room for improvement.</p>
